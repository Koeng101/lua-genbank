# Lua genbank

A genbank parser in pure lua with no dependencies. Most was rewritten from [poly's genbank parser](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/poly/blob/main/io/genbank/genbank.go).

Written in teal, converted to lua. Better documentation, location parsing, and import of the poly test suite in progress.
